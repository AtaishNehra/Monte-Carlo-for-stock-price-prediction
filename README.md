# Monte-Carlo-for-stock-price-prediction

MSFT Stock Price Simulation and Risk Analysis </br>
Project Overview </br>
This project involves conducting Monte Carlo simulations on historical Microsoft (MSFT) stock data to predict future prices and calculate risk metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). The analysis aims to enhance investment decision-making and risk management strategies. </br>
</br>
Features </br>
Data Extraction: Utilizes Yahoo Finance to extract historical stock price data for MSFT. </br>
Statistical Analysis: Calculates historical log returns, mean, variance, and standard deviation. </br>
Monte Carlo Simulations: Generates 10,000 simulations to model potential future stock prices. </br>
Risk Metrics: Calculates and visualizes VaR and CVaR to quantify financial risk. </br>
Visualization: Provides various plots for historical prices, log returns, density distributions, and simulated future prices. </br>
</br>
Technologies Used</br>
Python </br>
Libraries: numpy, pandas, yfinance, matplotlib, scipy </br>
</br>
Install Required Packages: </br>
Make sure you have numpy, pandas, yfinance, matplotlib, and scipy installed. You can install them using: </br>

</br>
Results </br>
Best, Average, and Worst Case Scenarios: Provides a range of possible future stock prices. </br>
Risk Metrics: Quantifies financial risk using VaR and CVaR. </br>
Confidence Intervals: Offers price ranges within 68% and 95% confidence intervals. </br>
</br>
Summary Statistics </br>
The project provides summary statistics of the simulated MSFT prices, including worst case, average case, best case, VaR, CVaR, mean, and standard deviation.
